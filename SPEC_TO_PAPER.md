# SPEC_TO_PAPER.md — Mapping `MaynardSpec.v` to arXiv:1311.4600 §7/§8

**Project:** Rocq formalisation of Maynard's `M_{105} > 4`
(`/home/rocq/prime_gap/`).
**Paper:** James Maynard, *Small gaps between primes*, arXiv:1311.4600.
- v1 (preprint, 2013): the relevant material is §7 — Lemmas 7.1, 7.2, 7.3.
- v3 (Annals 181 (2015) 383–413): the same material is §8 — Lemmas 8.1, 8.2, 8.3.

The two numberings are content-identical (`§7 ≡ §8`, `Lemma 7.x ≡ Lemma 8.x`).
Throughout this document we use the **v3 / Annals** numbering, consistent with
`REPORT.md`. Where the paper formula has a clear v1 line reference we list
both.

`MaynardSpec.v` transcribes Maynard's closed-form expressions for the matrix
entries `M_{1, ij}`, `M_{2, ij}` (Lemma 8.2) in two parallel forms — a
`rat`-valued spec for direct paper comparison, and a `(num, den) : Z * Z`
spec for `vm_compute`-friendly cross-checking against the FLINT-shipped
data. This document gives the line-level mapping from each Rocq definition
back to its paper counterpart.

## How to read this document

For each Rocq definition in `theories/S1/MaynardSpec.v` we give:

1. The Rocq source (file + approximate line range).
2. Maynard's paper formula in the v3/§8 numbering.
3. A symbol-by-symbol mapping `Rocq factor ↔ paper symbol`.
4. A small-`n` (or small-`k`) sanity check, where one is illuminating.

We close with two sections: what is verified *inside* the Rocq kernel
(by `vm_compute` over all 1764 entries of each matrix) and what is left
to the paper.

The reader is assumed to be comfortable with undergraduate linear algebra
and combinatorics. No prior knowledge of the project's internals or of
MathComp is required.

## 1. Conventions

### Paper conventions

In §8 Maynard works with smooth symmetric test functions
`F : ℝ_{≥0}^k → ℝ` supported on the simplex `{Σ t_i ≤ 1}` and with the
quadratic forms

```
I_k(F)       = ∫_{Δ_k} F(t)² dt
J_k^{(m)}(F) = ∫_{Δ_{k-1}}  ( ∫_0^{1 - Σ_{i ≠ m} t_i} F(t) dt_m )² dt_{≠ m}
M_k          = sup_F  ( Σ_m J_k^{(m)}(F) ) / I_k(F).
```

By symmetry of `F` in its `k` arguments, all `J_k^{(m)}` are equal, so
`Σ_m J_k^{(m)} = k · J_k^{(1)}`.

Maynard then **restricts** `F` (for tractability — paper p. 23, "for
simplicity") to the linear span of the monomials

```
((1 - P_1)^b · P_2^c)         with  b + 2c ≤ deg_max,    P_1 = Σ t_i,  P_2 = Σ t_i².
```

For `deg_max = 11` this span has dimension 42 (the basis in question; see
§7 below for the count). The matrices `M_1`, `M_2` are the Gram matrices
of the inner products `(F, G) ↦ I_k(F·G)` and `(F, G) ↦ J_k^{(1)}(F·G)` on
this 42-dimensional subspace. Lemma 8.2 gives closed forms for their
entries; Lemma 8.3 says

```
M_k = k · λ_max( M_1^{-1} M_2 )         (when M_2 is per-coordinate J_k^{(1)})
```

so any rigorous lower bound on `λ_max` of at least `4/k` would yield
`M_k > 4`.

In the paper, indices `(b_i, c_i)` and `(b_j, c_j)` denote the bidegrees
of the `i`-th and `j`-th basis monomials. The paper writes `k` for the
outer integration dimension; in our formalisation this is `k_param = 105`.

### Rocq conventions

`MaynardSpec.v` uses two parallel implementations of the same closed forms:

- **Part A (rat-level)**: `compositions`, `cff`, `G_2`, `M1_entry`,
  `alpha`, `M2_entry` — readable side-by-side with Maynard's paper, all
  valued in MathComp's `rat`.
- **Part B (Z-level)**: `compositionsZ`, `cffZ`, `G2Z`, `m1_num_den`,
  `alphaZ`, `m2_num_den` — same closed forms, but each rational result
  is presented as a `(num, den) : Z * Z` pair. Used by `MaynardVerify.v`
  because `vm_compute` on `'M[rat]_42` triggers MathComp's HB
  canonical-structure elaborator and stalls (REPORT.md §4d).

Part A and Part B are structurally isomorphic: every operation in Part A
has a directly corresponding operation in Part B. The kernel-Qed bridge
between them lives in `theories/S1/MaynardSpecBridge.v`:

```rocq
Theorem M1_spec_rat_eq (i j : nat) :
  M1_spec_ij i j = qfrac (m1_num_den_at i j).

Theorem M2_spec_rat_eq (i j : nat) :
  M2_spec_ij i j = qfrac (m2_num_den_at i j).
```

where `qfrac (n, d) := (Z_to_int n)%:~R / (Z_to_int d)%:~R : rat`. Both
theorems are `Qed` and `Print Assumptions` reports *Closed under the
global context* — no axioms, no `Uint63` primitives. The bridge is layered
through `factZ_to_rat`, `dblratZ_to_rat`, `binZ_to_rat`,
`compositionsZ_eq_compositions`, `G2Z_to_rat`, `qfrac_qmul`, `qfrac_qplus`,
and `alphaZ_to_rat`, each one a small structural induction.

`MaynardSpecBridge.v` is a leaf in the dependency DAG (`Cert.v` does not
import it) and is independent of `MaynardVerify.v`'s load-bearing Z-level
cross-check. Its purpose is to certify in the kernel that the rat-level
paper-form spec (the documentation-shaped Part A a reviewer reads against
the paper) and the Z-level computational spec (the Part B `vm_compute`
consumes) encode the same closed forms.

### The `K = 105` vs `K2 = 104` distinction

The constant of integration changes after the substitution that
"integrates out" `t_1` (Lemma 8.2 / eq. 8.8). Concretely:

- The outer integrand for `M_1` is taken over the `k`-simplex `Δ_k`:
  the Rocq spec uses `K1 := 105` (matches `Witness.k_param`).
- Inside `M_2`, after the eq. 8.8 expansion, the residual integral is
  on the `(k - 1)`-simplex `Δ_{k-1}`: the Rocq spec uses `K2 := 104`
  (= 105 − 1) for the `G_{·,2}` factor that appears at the second layer.

This is **not** a typo or an off-by-one: the algebraic reconciliation is
`K2 + b_sum + 2 c_sum = 105 + (b_i + b_j + 2c_i + 2c_j) + 1`, which is
exactly the M2 denominator written in Maynard's Lemma 8.2.

## 2. `MaynardSpec.compositions r n` ↔ Maynard's length-`r` compositions of `n`

### Source

`theories/S1/MaynardSpec.v`, in PART A:

```rocq
Fixpoint compositions_aux (r remaining : nat) : seq (seq nat) :=
  match r with
  | 0 => if (remaining == 0)%N then [:: [::] ] else [::]
  | S r' =>
      flatten
        [seq [seq (a :: tl) | tl <- compositions_aux r' (remaining - a)%N]
           | a <- iota 1 remaining]
  end.

Definition compositions (r n : nat) : seq (seq nat) := compositions_aux r n.
```

### Paper

The inner sum of Maynard's `G_{b, j}(x)` (Lemma 8.1) is indexed by

```
{ (b_1, …, b_r) ∈ ℕ_{≥1}^r  :  Σ b_s = b }.
```

That is, length-`r` compositions of `b` with parts ≥ 1. In our Rocq we use
`r` for the length and `n` for the total to avoid clashing with the basis
indices `(b_i, c_i)`.

### Mapping

| Rocq | Paper | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| `r` (first arg) | length of the composition `(b_1, …, b_r)` | |
| `n` (second arg) | the sum `Σ b_s = b` (= the polynomial degree in `G_{·,2}`) | |
| recursive call `compositions_aux r' (remaining - a)` | fix `b_1 = a`, recurse on `(b_2, …, b_r)` summing to `remaining − a` | |
| base `r = 0`, `remaining = 0` ⇒ `[[::]]` | the empty composition is the unique length-0 composition of 0 | |
| base `r = 0`, `remaining > 0` ⇒ `[::]` | a length-0 composition cannot sum to a positive number | |

### Sanity check

- `compositions 0 0 = [[::]]` — one empty composition.   ✓
- `compositions 0 n = [::]` for `n ≥ 1` — no length-0 composition of `n`.   ✓
- `compositions 1 4 = [[1]; [2]; [3]; [4]]` — but wait, only `[4]` sums
  to 4 with one part ≥ 1, so this should be `[[4]]`. **Verify:** the
  recursion `compositions_aux 1 4` goes `slots = 1`, `remaining = 4`, and
  iterates `a ∈ iota 1 4 = [1; 2; 3; 4]`. For each `a`, recurses on
  `compositions_aux 0 (4 − a)`; the inner result is `[[::]]` only when
  `4 − a = 0`, i.e. `a = 4`. For `a ∈ {1, 2, 3}` the inner result is
  `[::]` and contributes nothing. Net: `compositions 1 4 = [[4]]`.   ✓
- `compositions 2 4` enumerates `(b_1, b_2)`, both `≥ 1`, sum `= 4`:
  outputs `[[1; 3]; [2; 2]; [3; 1]]`.   ✓
- `compositions 3 4` enumerates length-3 compositions of 4: outputs
  `[[1; 1; 2]; [1; 2; 1]; [2; 1; 1]]`.   ✓

The Z-level twin `compositionsZ` in PART B has the same shape, differing
only in stdlib names (`List.flat_map` for `flatten ∘ map`, `List.seq` for
`iota`):

```rocq
Fixpoint compositions_auxZ (r remaining : nat) : list (list nat) :=
  match r with
  | O => if Nat.eqb remaining 0 then [nil] else nil
  | S r' =>
      List.flat_map
        (fun a => List.map (fun tl => a :: tl)
                           (compositions_auxZ r' (remaining - a)%nat))
        (List.seq 1 remaining)
  end.

Definition compositionsZ (r n : nat) : list (list nat) := compositions_auxZ r n.
```

`seq` is a notation for `list` in MathComp, so `compositions = compositionsZ`
as values for every `(r, n)` (modulo lemma `iota = List.seq`).

## 3. `MaynardSpec.cff` and `MaynardSpec.G_2` ↔ Maynard's `G_{n, 2}(k)`

### Source

`theories/S1/MaynardSpec.v`, PART A:

```rocq
Definition cff (a : seq nat) : rat :=
  \prod_(x <- a) (factQ (2 * x) / factQ x).

Definition G_2 (n k : nat) : rat :=
  if (n == 0)%N then 1
  else
    factQ n
    * \sum_(r <- iota 1 n) binQ k r * \sum_(a <- compositions r n) cff a.
```

### Paper

Maynard's **Lemma 8.1** (= v1 Lemma 7.1), specialised to `j = 2`:

```
G_{n, 2}(k) = n! · Σ_{r=1}^{n} C(k, r) · Σ_{(b_1,...,b_r) ∈ ℕ^r_{≥1}, Σ b_s = n}  Π_{s=1}^{r} (2 b_s)! / b_s!.
```

The convention `G_{0, 2}(k) := 1` (empty product) handles the `n = 0`
base case.

### Mapping

| Rocq | Paper |
|------|-------|
| `if n = 0 then 1` | `G_{0, 2}(k) := 1` |
| `factQ n` | `n!` (the global prefactor in front of the double sum) |
| `\sum_(r <- iota 1 n)` | `Σ_{r=1}^{n}` |
| `binQ k r` | `C(k, r)` |
| `\sum_(a <- compositions r n)` | `Σ_{(b_1,...,b_r), b_s ≥ 1, Σ = n}` |
| `cff a = \prod_(x <- a) (factQ (2x) / factQ x)` | `Π_{s=1}^{r} (2 b_s)! / b_s!` |

The Rocq formula is Maynard's Lemma 8.1 character-for-character.
`cff a` is the inner product factor; `G_2 n k` collects the `n!`
prefactor, the `r`-sum, the binomial coefficient, and the inner sum.

### Sanity checks

- `G_{0, 2}(k) = 1`.   ✓ (Rocq branch.)
- `G_{1, 2}(k) = 2k`.   The only length-1 composition of 1 is `[1]`,
  with `cff([1]) = 2!/1! = 2`. So `G_{1, 2}(k) = 1! · binom(k, 1) · 2 = 2k`. ✓
- `G_{2, 2}(k) = 4k² + 20k`.
  - Length 1: only composition is `[2]`, `cff([2]) = 4!/2! = 12`.
    Contribution: `binom(k, 1) · 12 = 12k`.
  - Length 2: only composition is `[1; 1]`, `cff([1;1]) = (2!/1!)² = 4`.
    Contribution: `binom(k, 2) · 4 = 2k(k − 1)`.
  - Total: `2! · (12k + 2k(k − 1)) = 2 · (12k + 2k² − 2k) = 4k² + 20k`. ✓

These three sanity values are spot-checked by `vm_compute` smoke tests
against `G_2 n k` for small `n, k`.

### PART B twin

```rocq
Definition cffZ (a : list nat) : Z := prod_dblratZ a.

Definition G2Z (n k : nat) : Z :=
  if Nat.eqb n O then 1
  else
    factZ n
    * List.fold_left Z.add
        (List.map (fun r =>
            binZ k r
            * List.fold_left Z.add
                (List.map cffZ (compositionsZ r n)) 0)
           (List.seq 1 n)) 0.
```

Here `prod_dblratZ a := Π_(x ∈ a) factZ (2 x) / factZ x` is the Z-integer
product; the integer divisions are exact because `factZ x ∣ factZ (2 x)`
for all `x`. Lifting `G2Z` to `rat` gives back `G_2` exactly.

## 4. `MaynardSpec.M1_entry` ↔ Maynard's `M_{1, ij}` (Lemma 8.2)

### Source

`theories/S1/MaynardSpec.v`, PART A:

```rocq
Definition K1 : nat := 105.
Definition K2 : nat := 104.

Definition M1_entry (bi ci bj cj : nat) : rat :=
  let b := (bi + bj)%N in
  let c := (ci + cj)%N in
  factQ b / factQ (K1 + b + 2 * c)%N * G_2 c K1.
```

### Paper

Maynard, **Lemma 8.2 (first part)**, paper p. 22 (v1 Lemma 7.2,
paper p. 19): for the basis monomial `((1 − P_1)^b P_2^c)`,

```
M_{1, ij}  =  (b_i + b_j)! · G_{c_i + c_j, 2}(k)  /  (k + b_i + b_j + 2 c_i + 2 c_j)!
```

with the convention `0! = 1`.

### Mapping

| Rocq | Paper |
|------|-------|
| `b := bi + bj` | `b_i + b_j` |
| `c := ci + cj` | `c_i + c_j` |
| `factQ b` | `(b_i + b_j)!` |
| `factQ (K1 + b + 2 * c)` | `(k + b_i + b_j + 2 c_i + 2 c_j)!`, with `K1 = k = 105` |
| `G_2 c K1` | `G_{c_i + c_j, 2}(k)` |

The Rocq formula is the paper formula verbatim modulo arithmetic
rearrangement.

### PART B twin

```rocq
Definition m1_num_den (bi ci bj cj : nat) : Z * Z :=
  let b := (bi + bj)%nat in
  let c := (ci + cj)%nat in
  (factZ b * G2Z c K1n, factZ (K1n + b + 2 * c)%nat).
```

i.e., `num = b! · G_{c, 2}(k)`, `den = (k + b + 2c)!`. Both are positive
integers, so `num/den = M1_entry` in `ℚ`.

---

## 5. `MaynardSpec.alpha` ↔ Maynard's eq. 8.8 expansion coefficient

This is the substitution that "integrates out" `t_1` in the inner
integral defining `J_k^{(1)}`. It is the heart of the M2 derivation
and is worth describing carefully.

### Source

`theories/S1/MaynardSpec.v`, PART A:

```rocq
Definition alpha (b c cp : nat) : rat :=
  binQ c cp * factQ b * factQ (2 * c - 2 * cp)%N
    / factQ (b + 2 * c - 2 * cp + 1)%N.
```

### Paper

Maynard, **Lemma 8.2, eq. 8.8** (v1 eq. 7.10): one fixes a basis monomial
`F_i = (1 − P_1)^{b_i} P_2^{c_i}` and computes

```
∫_0^{1 − Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j}   F_i(t)   d t_1
   =   Σ_{c'_1 = 0}^{c_i}   α(b_i, c_i, c'_1)
                          · ( 1 − Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j )^{ b_i + 2 c_i − 2 c'_1 + 1 }
                          · ( Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j² )^{ c'_1 }
```

with

```
α(b, c, c')  =  C(c, c') · b! · (2c − 2c')! / (b + 2c − 2c' + 1)!.
```

Algebraically: starting from `(1 − P_1)^b · P_2^c`, write `P_2 =
t_1² + Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j²`, expand `P_2^c` by the binomial theorem with
index `c'`, then integrate `t_1^{2(c − c')} (1 − Σ_j t_j)^b` from
`t_1 = 0` to `t_1 = 1 − Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j` using the standard Beta-function
identity

```
∫_0^X t^a (X − t)^b dt = a! · b! · X^{a+b+1} / (a + b + 1)!.
```

The factor `(2c − 2c')!` in the numerator is `a! = (2(c − c'))!`, and
the `b! · X^{a+b+1} / (a + b + 1)!` shape rearranges to the `α` displayed
above (the `b! / (b + 2c − 2c' + 1)!` part), with `X = 1 − Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j`
producing the first power tail of the eq. 8.8 right-hand side and the
remaining `Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j²` producing the `( · )^{c'}` factor.

### Mapping

| Rocq | Paper |
|------|-------|
| `binQ c cp` | `C(c, c')` (binomial-theorem expansion of `P_2^c`) |
| `factQ b` | `b!` (numerator from the Beta integral) |
| `factQ (2*c - 2*cp)` | `(2c − 2c')!`, the `a!` of the Beta integral with `a = 2(c − c')` |
| `factQ (b + 2*c - 2*cp + 1)` | `(b + 2c − 2c' + 1)!`, the `(a + b + 1)!` of the Beta integral |

### PART B twin

```rocq
Definition alphaZ (b c cp : nat) : Z * Z :=
  (binZ c cp * factZ b * factZ (2 * c - 2 * cp)%nat,
   factZ (b + 2 * c - 2 * cp + 1)%nat).
```

`binZ c cp` is integer-valued (when `cp ≤ c`), so the numerator is a
positive integer, and the denominator is a positive factorial.

```

### Paper

Maynard, **Lemma 8.2 (second part)**, paper p. 22 (v1 Lemma 7.2,
p. 19): the per-coordinate matrix entry `M_{2, ij}^{(1)}` (i.e. the
integrand from `J_k^{(1)}`, **not** `Σ_m J_k^{(m)}`). After applying the
eq. 8.8 substitution to both `F_i` and `F_j`, one is left with a
double sum over `(c'_1, c'_2) ∈ [0, c_i] × [0, c_j]` of:

```
α(b_i, c_i, c'_1) · α(b_j, c_j, c'_2)
  · ∫_{Δ_{k-1}}  ( 1 − Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j )^{b'_1 + b'_2}  ( Σ_{j ≠ 1} t_j² )^{c'_1 + c'_2}  d t_{≠1}
```

with `b'_1 = b_i + 2c_i − 2c'_1 + 1`, `b'_2 = b_j + 2c_j − 2c'_2 + 1`.
The remaining integral is exactly Lemma 8.1 / eq. 8.4 evaluated at degree
`(b'_1 + b'_2, c'_1 + c'_2)` over the `(k − 1)`-simplex. So it equals

```
(b'_1 + b'_2)! · G_{c'_1 + c'_2, 2}(k − 1)  /  ( (k − 1) + b'_1 + b'_2 + 2 (c'_1 + c'_2) + 1)!
=  (b_sum)! · G_{c_sum, 2}(k − 1)  /  (104 + b_sum + 2 c_sum)!
```

since `(k − 1) + 1 = k = 105` and our `K2 = k − 1 = 104` on the RHS.

**Caveat on eq. 8.4 (paper p. 409).** Maynard's eq. 8.4 — the
closed-form Beta–Dirichlet integral
`∫_{Δ_n} (1 − Σ t_j)^b (Σ t_j²)^c dt = b! · G_{c,2}(n) / (n + b + 2c + 1)!`
— is stated under the implicit hypothesis `b ≠ 0`. The `b = 0` case
has a different closed form (the volume term `1/n!` vs the formal
substitution `1/(n+1)!`). For our M2 application this is harmless:
the M2 integrand is invoked with `b_sum = b'_1 + b'_2 = b_i + b_j +
2(c_i + c_j) − 2(c'_1 + c'_2) + 2`, and since `c'_1 ≤ c_i`,
`c'_2 ≤ c_j`, we have `b_sum ≥ 2 > 0` for every term in the M2
double sum. So eq. 8.4 is always applied in the `b ≠ 0` regime
in our derivation.

For the M1 integrand the corresponding `b = b_i + b_j` *can* be
zero (when `b_i = b_j = 0`, e.g. the `(0, 0)` × `(0, 0)` basis
entry). The M1 formula in our `M1_entry` treats this case using
the same closed-form expression as for `b ≠ 0`; this is consistent
with Maynard's Lemma 8.2 first part as written, which gives the
M1 entries directly as `b! · G_{c, 2}(k) / (k + b + 2c)!` for all
`b ≥ 0`. In particular Maynard's M1 closed form does not invoke
eq. 8.4's `b = 0` corner case — it is derived independently for
M1, before eq. 8.8's substitution introduces the `+1` in `b'_i`.
So the corner case of eq. 8.4 is not silently assumed in either
M1 or M2.

### Mapping

| `G_2 csum K2` | `G_{c'_1 + c'_2, 2}(k − 1)` |

This matches Maynard's formula on p. 22 verbatim; the explicit
reconciliation `K2 + b_sum + 2 c_sum = 105 + (b_i + b_j + 2 c_i + 2 c_j) + 1`
follows from `K2 + 1 = 105`.

### Why the `k` factor lives in the threshold, not the matrix

By symmetry of `F` in its `k` variables, `Σ_m J_k^{(m)}(F) = k · J_k^{(1)}(F)`,
so

```
M_k = sup_F  Σ_m J_k^{(m)}(F) / I_k(F)
    = sup_F  k · J_k^{(1)}(F) / I_k(F)
    = k · λ_max( M_1^{-1} · M_2 )
```

where `M_2` is **per-coordinate** `J_k^{(1)}` (what `M2_entry` computes).
Equivalently, the Cert.v threshold

```
λ_max( M_1^{-1} · M_2 )  >  4 / k  =  4 / 105
```

is what gives `M_k > 4`. The Rocq layer proves the existence of *some*
real eigenvalue of `M_1^{-1} M_2` strictly above `4 / 105`, which is
≤ `λ_max` (max ≥ any). The factor `k = 105` is paid in the threshold
`4 / 105`, *not* in the matrix entries.

### PART B twin

`m2_num_den` in PART B folds `qplus`/`qmul` over the same double sum,
accumulating a single `(num, den)` pair per `(i, j)` entry. The fold uses

```rocq
Definition qplus (p q : Z * Z) : Z * Z :=
  let '(a, b) := p in let '(c, d) := q in (a * d + c * b, b * d).
Definition qmul (p q : Z * Z) : Z * Z :=
  let '(a, b) := p in let '(c, d) := q in (a * c, b * d).
```

so that lifting back to `rat` gives `M2_entry` exactly.

### Paper

Maynard, p. 23 (v1 p. 21–22), the "for simplicity" reduction:

> "We restrict our attention to test functions of the form `F = Σ a_{b,c}
> (1 − P_1)^b P_2^c`" with `P_1 = Σ t_i`, `P_2 = Σ t_i²` and `b + 2c ≤
> deg_max`.

For `deg_max = 11`, the set

```
{ (b, c) ∈ ℕ²  :  b + 2c ≤ 11 }
```

has `Σ_{c = 0}^{5} (12 − 2c) = 12 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 42` elements.

### Mapping

The Rocq list is exactly this set, ordered by the Mathematica enumeration
used in `python/flint_probe.py` (the `xExponents_mma(5)` /
`yExponents_mma(5)` order).

`Witness.basis` (autogenerated from `python/certificate.json`) and
`MaynardBasis.maynard_basis` (hand-readable in the .v file) are pinned
together by `maynard_basis_eq_witness`, a `vm_compute` lemma. So the
basis a reviewer reads in `MaynardBasis.v` is the *same* basis the
shipped matrix entries are indexed by.

### What this restriction is and is not

This is a **lower-bound subspace**. Maynard's full optimisation problem
is over all symmetric `F` with `deg ≤ 11` in 105 variables; restricting
to polynomials in the two power sums `P_1, P_2` is a strict subspace.
The supremum of a Rayleigh quotient over a subspace is `≤` the
unrestricted supremum. So:

```
M_{105}  =  sup over full space  ≥  k · λ_max( M_1^{-1} M_2 )  on this 42-dim subspace.
```

Because we are proving a *lower bound* `M_{105} > 4`, the subspace
restriction goes the right way. This is the "for simplicity" reduction
in Maynard p. 23.

## 8. What is verified inside the Rocq kernel

`MaynardVerify.v` cross-checks every entry of the shipped integer
matrices against `MaynardSpec` via Z-level cross-multiplication:

```rocq
Definition M1_entry_matchZ (i j : nat) : bool :=
  Z.eqb (m1_num i j * D_M1)
        (mat_get M1_int i j * m1_den i j).

Definition all_match_M1Z : bool :=
  List.forallb
    (fun i => List.forallb (fun j => M1_entry_matchZ i j) (List.seq 0 42))
    (List.seq 0 42).

Lemma all_match_M1Z_true : all_match_M1Z = true.
Proof. vm_compute. reflexivity. Qed.
```

(and analogously for `M2`). Both `Lemma`s are `Qed` and close by a
single `vm_compute`. `Print Assumptions` reports "Closed under the
global context" — no axioms, not even Uint63 primitives, are involved
(the proof is pure stdlib `Z` arithmetic).

**Coverage:** `42 × 42 = 1764` entries per matrix, so 3528 per-entry
checks total. The check is the standard rational identity
`a/b = c/d ⟺ a · d = b · c` for positive `b, d`, applied to
`(M_int[i][j], D_M_l)` and `(num_spec[i][j], den_spec[i][j])`.

**Timing** (REPORT.md §3.8): ~90 s for `M1`, ~35 min for `M2`. The
M2 cost dominates because each entry is a sum of up to `(c_i + 1)
× (c_j + 1) ≤ 36` terms, each of which forms a full `G_{·,2}(104)`
expansion — the per-term denominator grows to thousands of digits
before `qplus` collapses it.

## 9. What is NOT verified inside Rocq

### 9.1 Lemma 8.3 (`M_k = k · λ_max(M_1^{-1} M_2)`) — *paper-side only*

The Rocq layer proves "there exists a real algebraic eigenvalue of
`M_1^{-1} M_2` strictly above `4/105`" (`Cert.maynard_eigenvalue_S1`).
Bridging this to `M_{105} > 4` requires:

(a) Lemma 8.3's identity `M_k = k · λ_max(M_1^{-1} M_2)`
    (Lagrange multipliers over a positive-definite Gram matrix), and
(b) the trivial `λ_max ≥ any real eigenvalue`.

Both are taken on the paper side (REPORT.md §1.4 makes the same
disclosure).

### 9.2 Reality of the spectrum of `M_1^{-1} M_2`

Inside Rocq we work in `realalg`, the real algebraic closure of `ℚ`,
so any eigenvalue we extract via IVT is automatically real. We do not
formalise the structural claim "the spectrum of `M_1^{-1} M_2` is real
because `M_1` is symmetric PD and `M_2` is symmetric" (Sylvester's law /
generalised eigenvalue problem). This is correct on the paper side:
`M_1`, `M_2` are Gram matrices of `L^2` inner products on a 42-dimensional
subspace of polynomials, hence symmetric; `M_1` is PD because
`aᵀ M_1 a = ∫ F² ≥ 0` with equality only at `F = 0`.

### 9.3 The Beta-integral derivation `J_k(F)/I_k(F) → closed form`

The closed-form rational formulas in §3–§6 above (Lemma 8.1 / 8.2)
are taken as **definitions** in Rocq. The analytic derivation —
Beta-function identity for `∫_0^X t^a (X − t)^b dt`, integrate `t_1`
out via eq. 8.8, sum over compositions — is the content of Lemma 8.1's
proof in Maynard. We do not reproduce this analytic step inside Rocq.

What Rocq *does* certify is that the resulting closed-form rational
matches the shipped integer matrix `M1_int / D_M1`, `M2_int / D_M2`
entry-for-entry. So if a reviewer accepts Maynard's Lemma 8.1 / 8.2
on paper, the kernel guarantees the matrices `Cert.v` consumes are
exactly the Maynard matrices.
